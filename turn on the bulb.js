//Turn on the Bulbs


// There are A bulbs lined in a row numbered 1 to A, which are off initially. In one step, 
// you can choose any bulb and turn it on.
// If you turn a particular bulb on, the bulb 2 places to the right and 
// 2 places to the left of this bulb would also turn on. 
// Bulbs that are already on will not be affected. 
// Formally, if you turn on the bulb numbered X, it will also turn on the bulb 
// numbered X - 2 (if it exists) and bulb numbered X + 2 (if it exists).
// Find the minimum number of steps required to turn on all the bulbs.

const solve = (a) => {
    let bulb;
    bulb = Math.min(a % 6, 2) + (a / 6) * 2;
    return bulb;
}

console.log(solve(3));
